*btcrecover* is an open source wallet password and seed recovery tool. It is designed for the case where you already know most of your password or seed phrase, but need assistance in trying different possible combinations.

* Seed/Passphrase Recovery when you have a known address you have used for:
    * Bitcoin
    * Bitcoin Cash
    * Ethereum
    * Litecoin
    * Dash
    * Dogecoin
    * Vertcoin
    * Monacoin
    * DigiByte
    * And many other 'Bitcoin Like' cryptos
 * Seed/Passphrase recovery via Address DB (Where you don't need to know an address to search for) supporting:
    * Bitcoin
    * Bitcoin Cash
    * Litecoin
    * Vertcoin
    * Monacoin
    * DigiByte
    * Likely many other 'Bitcoin like' cryptos
 * [Descrambling 12 word seeds](docs/BIP39_descrambling_seedlists.md) (Using Tokenlist feature for BIP39 seeds via seedrecover.py)
 * Wallet File password recovery for a range of wallets

**_If you want the tool to support a crypto that isn't listed above, please test that it works and submit a PR which includes a unit test for that coin and also any required code to accept the address format._**

## Setup and Usage Tutorials ##
BTCRecover is a Python (3.6+) script so will run on Windows, Linux and Mac environments. [See the installation guide for more info](INSTALL.md)

[I have created a growing playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7rfJxwogDzmd1IanPrmlTg3ewAIq-BZJ) that covers a number of usage examples for using this tool to recover seed phrases, BIP39 passphrases, etc.

This repositoy also included some [example commands and file templates](docs/Usage_Examples/UsageExamples.md) for the usage scenarios covered in YouTube videos.

My suggestion is that you find a scenario that is most-like your situation and try to replicate my examples to ensure that you have the tool set up and running correctly. If you have a specific situation that isn't covered in these tutorials, let me know and I can look into creating a video for that.

[Sending me a message via Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Crypto-Guide) is likely the best channel to reach me for support with this tool.

If you don't know an address in the wallet that you are searching for, you can create and use an [Address Database](docs/Creating_and_Using_AddressDB.md) _There is no real performance penalty for doing this, it just takes a bit more work to set up_.

## Quick Start ##

To try recovering your password or a BIP39 passphrase, please start with the **[Password Recovery Quick Start](TUTORIAL.md#btcrecover-tutorial)**.

If you mostly know your recovery seed/mnemonic (12-24 recovery words), but think there may be a mistake in it, please see the **[Seed Recovery Quick Start](docs/Seedrecover_Quick_Start_Guide.md)**.
